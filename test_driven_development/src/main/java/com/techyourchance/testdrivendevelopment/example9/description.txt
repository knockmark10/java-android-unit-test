Description:
Your goal is to implement AddToCartUseCaseSync class using TDD.

The requirements:
1) You should use AddToCartHttpEndpointSync interface as dependency injected from constructor
2) You should add a method called addToCartSync to add items to the cart
3) If server answers with SUCCESS, SUCCESS result must be returned
4) If server returns any kind of error, FAILURE result must be returned

You should:
1) Create a new implementation of the class WITHOUT writing any actual functionality.
2) Create a new test class for your implementation.
3) Write all the required tests.
4) Run the tests and ensure that all of them fail.
5) Write the required production code.
6) Run the tests and ensure that all of them pass. Debug if necessary.
7) Refactor the production code for readability and maintainability.
8) Refactor the test code for readability and maintainability.
9) Assign your implementation to SUT in the class FetchUserUseCaseSyncTestRef.
10) Ensure that all reference tests pass. Debug if necessary.
